## About This Project

This repository contains eight Python (.py) files, each relating to a specific topic covered as part of the Programming and Scripting module of the [HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics), ATU Galway. In addition to the eight Python files, the repository contains this README.md fie and a .gitignore file. Below is a brief description of each file:

At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
The program ends if the current value is one.

5. *weekday.py*
Topic 5: Data Structures

8. *plotask.py*
Topic 8: Plots
Description: Program that displays:
- a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2,
- plot of the function $h(x)=x^3$ in the range 0 to 10,
on one set of the axes.

9. *README.md*
Description: This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
